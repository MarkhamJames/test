## Project Usage

Chuck Norris Jokes is a program built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to provide the user with an endless supply of Chuck Norris.  A joke appears on the screen after the user enters his or her name into the input field and presses the play button.  The program delivers a joke using the entered name.     


## API
www.icndb.com is the base URL where the API used in this program "the Internet Chuck Norris Database is located".  This API is the source for all the Chuck Norris jokes that appear on screen once the user name is entered.

## About the Site
The idea for this website was formulated with the intent to successfully retrieve data from an external API after receiving a command from the user.  One major hurdle that I encountered during the program's construction involved entering a separate first and last name coming from the user input into their respective indices in the API UPL endpoint.  The user enters a string value inside the input bar which needs to be converted into an array.  This array then needs to be split into two indices representing the First and Last name using the '.split' method.  This array then can be used in the URL endpoint.  Font and header changes are utilized for different screen sizes.
